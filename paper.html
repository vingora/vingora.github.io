	            <h2>NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES)</h2>
	            <h3>Recommendation: Buy</h3>
	            <h3>Current Price: $68.3</h3>
	            <h3>Price Target:   $98.7 in 24months</h3>
	            <div>
	                <p>NetEase is undervalued primarily because it is not a “fashion’ company, and the conservative style of senior managements. Different from its non-fashion style, the company maintains a high growth rate both in terms of revenue and cash flows in the last decade. In 2013, the company achieved a net profit of $734mm, representing a PE ratio of 7.4x (net cash). Comparing to its peers, it is among the lowest, while Giant at 10.8x, Tencent is around 50x and Yahoo is around 30x.</p> 
	                <p>In my view, the market is underdetermining the NetEase’s product development and operation capabilities and monetization of product portfolio under mobile threat.  </p>
	                <p>The company is different on the other hand - it has a strong balance sheet, with a cash & short investment of $32bn, which accounts for 39% of its market cap. It has no debt, and doesn’t do acquisitions. Things are about to change in the coming few years as NTES begins to change its dividend policy and buyback its own stocks, and try to optimize its capital structure. </p>
	                <p>While the high loyalty of customers (as long as its high product quality and customer service) will defend its current financial performance, the possible monetization of its extensive products portfolio and oversea expansion would bring growth to NTES. </p>

	            <h4>Investment Thesis</h4>
	            <ol>
	                <li>Concerns on online game aging is overdone.</li>
	                <li>Monetization of its mobile games, new online games and oversea expansion.</li>
	                <li>New dividend policy and buy-back program with strong cash flows and balance sheet.</li>
	                <li>Entrepreneurship spirit and strong culture of the companies continues create real value.</li>
